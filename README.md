# An event based simulator for single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) systems
A julia based simulator for SPAD systems. The simulator is event based and can simulate both single SPAD and gated SPAD systems. Old verilog-ams models of the SPADs based on work from my PhD are included as well. To simulate the veriloga files a simulator/compiler such as Xcelium is needed. Will try and test the models with an open source framework such as OpenVAF

## Capabilities

Single and gated SPADs so far... work in progress.

### Single SPAD simulation

### Gated SPAD simulation

## Todo
